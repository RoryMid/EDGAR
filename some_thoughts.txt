Based on our analysis (of 85% of data), our options are:
 - buy
 - sell
 - hold
      our stocks.

So decide what we'd want to do and test that on the remaining 15% (test set) to see if we make money.
 - don't just want to make money, want to beat the average stock increase (e.g. APPL up by 30% (?) annually).

We don't just want to predict return.  We predict:
 - return
 - volume
 - volatility

Note that current market sentiment also important.
"Negative" 10K report would have positive affect on share price if is less negative than expected.
